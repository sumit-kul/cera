											<p>
												"Cookies" are small data file identifiers placed onto your device that enables Jhapak to identify your browser 
												or device and transfer information about you and your use of our Services. For example, cookies that we use tell us 
												how many times you have visited one of our websites, your search preferences, and if you have clicked on an advertisement 
												that has been displayed to you.<br />
												We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an 
												existing user, so it's easier to return to Jhapak without signing in again. After you log in, a persistent cookie stays 
												in your browser and will be read by Jhapak when you return to the site.<br />Session cookies only last for as long as 
												the session (usually the current visit to a web site or a browser session) and are deleted from your computer when you log off 
												from a Service and close your browser.. We use session cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand 
												how you interact with the Services and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the Services.<br />
												We, and third parties with whom we partner, may also deliver a file knowns as a web beacon, pixel or pixel tag ("Web Beacons") 
												to you through our Services from an ad network. Web Beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Service 
												interface or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Service interface, 
												such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to determine if an email has been opened and acted upon. Web Beacons 
												allow ad networks and service providers that we use to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us, 
												for advertisers and our other partners. Web Beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you 
												visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and Web Beacons from the ad network's servers, 
												these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

													<ul class="outer">
														<li style="line-height: 1.2; border: none;">

													<p>
														If you want to stop using your account at Jhapak, it will be initially deactivated but will not be deleted. We save your profile information 
														in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain 
														their information until they return to Jhapak. You will therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 30 
														days of deactivating it.<br />
														After the expiration of 30 days, your account is permanently deleted from Jhapak. You should only delete your account if you are certain you 
														never want to restore it.<br>
														To prevent abuse and/or misuse of Jhapak by a user following termination or deletion of a profile/account we shall retain such information 
														as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that user does not open a new account and profile in breach of our Terms and Conditions of 
														Use and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.<br />
														Warning: Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed 
														on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or to the extent such information 
														has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or 
														websites access to your personal information they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.
