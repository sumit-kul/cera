							Jhapak is a social collaboration solution for personal and enterprises. It enables like-minded people to form communities where they can explore, learn and share. 
							As a registered member of Jhapak, you can create your own community to serve as a common ground for people who share the same interest. 
							You can also explore and learn public communities without joining us. To maximum utilise knowledge shared within a community, joining that 
							community is must.<br /><br />
							Community is at the heart of all we do at Jhapak. Jhapak members use community features (Blogs, Forums, Wikis, etc.) to inspire 
							each other, share knowledge, discuss ideas, and build personal and professional relationships.<br /><br />
							To make sure that Jhapak continues to be a place that's safe, interesting, respectful and productive, we've developed a set of Community 
							Guidelines, outlined below. These guidelines will help you understand what type of sharing is allowed on Jhapak, and what type of content 
							may be reported to us and removed. These Guidelines and our Terms and Conditions are designed to ensure every user can enjoy Jhapak safely 
							and responsibly. We expect each member to conduct themselves with integrity, decency and respect, and your use of Jhapak is subject to the 
							Jhapak's Community Guidelines and the Terms and Conditions of Use.<br /><br />
							Violating the Community Guidelines may result in the termination of your Jhapak account without warning.

													<strong>Be real:</strong> People will respect you more, engage with you more often, and treat you like a real 
													person if you use your actual identity here. Have the courage to be you - instead of "ABC 72". While not mandatory, 
													we think you'll have a much better online experience when you stand behind your actual words.
												</li>
												<li style="line-height: 1.2; border: none;">
													<strong>Be nice:</strong> We're a global community of many types of people, who all have the right to feel 
													comfortable and who may not think what you think, believe what you believe, or see what you see. So, be polite 
													and respectful in your interactions with other members.<br />
													Jhapak shouldn't be used to harm others. Terrorists and those who engage in violent crimes are not welcome 
													on Jhapak. It is not okay to use our Services to harass, abuse, or send other unwelcomed communications to 
													people (e.g., junk mail, spam, chain letters, phishing schemes). Do not use Jhapak's services to promote or threaten 
													violence or property damage, or for hate speech acts like attacking people because of their race, ethnicity, national origin, 
													gender, sexual orientation, political or religious affiliations, or medical or physical condition. 
												</li>
												<li style="line-height: 1.2; border: none;">
													<strong>Don't be mean or obscene:</strong> Because children as young as 13 may participate in Jhapak, sexually explicit 
													and vulgar language is not welcome on the site. It is not okay to share obscene images or pornography on Jhapak's Service. 
													Also not welcome are belligerence, insults, slurs and generally objectionable speech. If you wouldn't say it in public, don't 
													post it on Jhapak.
												</li>
												<li style="line-height: 1.2; border: none;">
													<strong>Respect other users and Follow the Law:</strong> We do not want Jhapak to be used for illegal activities or to 
													violate the rights of others. Don't use our services to commit fraud. Members of Jhapak are not above the law so don't 
													post anything that violates the laws of your country, county, region or town/city. Don't try to trick people into sharing their 
													personal information, steal anything (such as copyright or trademark material) or break into places you shouldn't be. Don't threaten, 
													harass, impersonate or hurt others and don't invade other people's privacy.

												An online community is a group of like-minded people interacting, sharing, exploring and working toward a common goal. Whereas neighbors 
												may converse in their yards, in an online community, members interact via social networks and share in forums, e-mail groups, and even in 
												the comments sections of blog posts and news articles.<br />
												Members of online communities talk about the same things with their online friends/contacts as they do their offline neighbors, but they 
												also rally around a specific topic, product, or cause to share ideas, offer tips, or act as mentors.<br />
												Online communities are best explained by exploring offline real life neighborhood communities. Close-knit neighbors not only socialize, but 
												they also help each other. They borrow tools and bring in the mail. They make dinner for sick parents and trade off watching kids. They also 
												maintain common interests - for example, working together to keep common areas attractive and productive.

													<strong>A community must have a moderator:</strong> Each community must have one or more moderator who network and connect community 
													members by identifying the needs of the community, encouraging participation, facilitating and seeding discussions, and by keeping events 
													and community activities engaging and vibrant.<br />
													His/her key responsibilities include identify the community needs, accept and welcome new community members, post insightful comments and 
													make provocative points in online discussions in order to keep them engaging, flowing, and vibrant.

												</li>
												<li style="line-height: 1.2; border: none;">
													<strong>Community must have a purpose:</strong> Your community must be started with a predefined purpose that matters to the people you're 
													trying to reach/join. You shouldn't be creating the purpose, you should find a purpose a lot of people care about and build a community around it. 
												</li>
												<li style="line-height: 1.2; border: none;">
													<strong>Create content about community:</strong> Community must be described well and its purpose must be explained clearly. Remember, communities 
													are about people and for people, make sure you write about community members as much as you write about your community. 
												</li>
												<li style="line-height: 1.2; border: none;">
													<strong>Build personal relationships with members:</strong> If you want to have real authority, you must be liked by the people who your community 
													respects. You need to have good, two-way, relationships with your top members. 
												</li>
												<li style="line-height: 1.2; border: none;">
													<strong>Recognise individual contributions:</strong> People should love to be recognised as much as you should love to recognise them. Recognition 
													is free to give and the most important way to encourage further contributions. 
												</li>
												<li style="line-height: 1.2; border: none;">
													<strong>Mind Your Manners:</strong> Community members should express themselves in a respectful manner. Any member contribution, regardless of form, 
													that is derogatory, abusive, offensive, obscene, violent, or otherwise deemed inappropriate is forbidden. 
												</li>
												<li style="line-height: 1.2; border: none;">
													<strong>Keep it Spam-Free:</strong> Community should not be designed as a means to advance the business interests of any individual member or group of members. 
													Good contributions help the entire community by providing relevant, insightful information or asking important questions. Contributions should never include 
													advertising or marketing messages.
