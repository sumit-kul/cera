							The Summary
						</p>
						<p>
							Welcome, and thanks for using Jhapak and its Srevices. You should read these terms and conditions in full because

							a quick summary:
						</p>
						<ul class="outer">
							<li style="line-height: 1.2;">
								We are not responsible for anything that you post or say while you are on Jhapak and we don't monitor the 
								content of the site, but if we do see or someone alerts us that you have posted something that we think is inappropriate 
								then we are allowed at our discretion to remove it.
							</li>
							<li style="line-height: 1.2;">
								If you post any content that actually belongs to someone else and they get annoyed (or even call in their lawyers), 
								we are not in the firing line. You have to take responsibility for what you post.
							</li>
							<li style="line-height: 1.2;">
								If you are concerned about how your data is being used by Jhapak then please refer to our Privacy Policy.

													the right at our sole discretion, at any time and without liability or the need to give you prior notice to suspend or

													<strong>By you:</strong> If you have registered on Jhapak, you can terminate your registration at any time by going to 
													the "Settings" page on Jhapak when you are logged in and choosing the 'Remove my registration' link. We save your profile 
													information in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and 
													in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to Badoo. You will therefore be able to restore your 
													account and your profile in its entirety within 30 days of de-activating it. Once your registration is terminated, we have 
													the right to delete any related Content that you have submitted or uploaded on to Jhapak. For further details, please 
													refer to our Privacy Policy. Content that you have uploaded to Jhapak, other than your Profile (such as images, video, blogs, 
													forum topics, wiki entries, etc.), may still appear on Jhapak following termination of your registration.
